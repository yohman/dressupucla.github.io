## Biography

Pete is an Academic Projects Developer in the UCLA Digital Library Program, working with faculty, library specialists, and students to develop novel online resources that use emerging technologies in computational analysis, digital archiving, and multimedia presentation to support collaborative scholarship in the humanities and social sciences. Peter has a dual background in the humanities (PhD in Musicology from UCLA) and computer science (MS from UC Berkeley) and has been actively involved in digital scholarship projects for the past seven years. Some of the projects he has helped to implement involve text mining and geo-semantic mapping of folklore and literary texts from a variety of cultures and eras, such as nineteenth-century Denmark, medieval Iceland, and the Tang Dynasty in China; social network analyses of East Asian pop music groups and Hollywood composer collaborations; and the application of machine-learning algorithms to mine large digital corpora, including library circulation records, contemporary television news and social media collections, and Holocaust survivor testimonies.
